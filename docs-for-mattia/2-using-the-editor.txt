This file contains information on how to use the editor.

Bold - Works similarly to Microsoft Word

Italic - Also works similarly to Microsoft Word

Lists - Similar to Microsoft Word. To exit list mode, press enter twice.

Hyperlinks - Highlight the text you want to make into a link. Press the hyperlink button. A textbox should appear. Put the link you want and press OK.
		
	Links point to the file name. For example, to link to the Contact Us page, you would put the name of the Contact Us file.

		Link to Contact Us -> /contact-us.html
		Link to Homepage   -> /index.html
		Link to Document   -> /doc.html

	To link to an external website, just copy-paste the url.

		Link to Google     -> http://google.ca

Image - To add an image, press the image button. A textbox will appear. Put the location of the image you want and press OK.

	Image links point to the file name. For example, to add an image called Canada16.png that is located in the folder img, we put the file path.

		Canada16 image -> img/Canada16.png

	We can also use pictures on the internet by using the url.

		Google logo -> https://www.google.ca/images/srpr/logo11w.png

	If you use this method, the images will appear full size on the page. If you want them to be resized (like in the photo gallery), see adding-images.txt. 

Headers (H1/H2) - For our purposes, the buttons do the same thing. Select the text you want to make into a title and press h1 or h2.

Dictation - This does not work
