Adding images to the photo gallery/other docs page is difficult in the editor. It is much easier to directly edit the html file.

0. Figure out which file is the one you want to add/remove an image.

Photo Gallery -> gallery.html
Other Docs    -> other-docs.html

NOTICE: THIS WILL ONLY WORK FOR THESE 2 FILES! To add images to other files, see using-the-editor.txt

1. Open Notepad. Go to File -> Open. A popup will appear. Change the dropdown from "Text Documents (*.txt)" to "All Files". Navigate to the repo root (My Documents/GitHub/squaredcircle) in the popup window. Open the file you want to edit.

2. You should see lines that look like

		<a href="doc-img/image001.jpg"><img src="doc-img/image001.jpg" ></img></a>

   Say you want to add an image named Canada16.png and this image is located in the folder named img. You would add the line:

   		<a href="img/Canada16.png"><img src="img/Canada16.png" ></img></a>

   If you wanted to add a title like "This is a Canada flag" you add a title attribute like so:

   		<a title="This is a Canada flag" href="img/Canada16.png"><img src="img/Canada16.png" ></img></a>

   	If you want to delete an image, just remove the corresponding line.

   	If you want to add a title to an existing image, just add the title attribute like above. The title cannot contain the double quote character ("). The title appears when you click on the image.

   	If you want to add a new section title like "My favourite stamps" add the line

   		<h2>My favourite stamps</h2>

   	All the images below that title will be in that section.
