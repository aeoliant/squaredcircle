1. Open Notepad. Go to File -> Open. A popup will appear. Change the dropdown from "Text Documents (*.txt)" to "All Files". Navigate to the repo root (My Documents/GitHub/squaredcircle) in the popup window. Open the file you want to edit.

2. Open editor.html in an internet browser. Press the button that looks like </>. This button switches the editor view from normal to html. See using-the-editor.txt for more information.

3. Go back to Notepad. Select everything between the lines <!-- BEGIN COPY-PASTE --> <!-- END COPY-PASTE -->. Copy it (using Edit -> Copy or crtl-c) and paste it in the internet browser (using Edit -> Paste or crtl-v). Afterwards, press the button that looks like </>. You should now see your website in the editor.html window.

5. In the editor window, press the button that looks like </>. Select all (Edit -> Select All or crtl-a). Copy and paste the text back into Notepad, between the lines <!-- BEGIN COPY-PASTE --> <!-- END COPY-PASTE -->. Save the file.
