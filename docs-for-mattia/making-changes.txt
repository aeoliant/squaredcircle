# CHANGING TEXT #
#################

An example of changing text would be fixing spelling, or changing words/phrasing, or adding text to an existing block of text.

0. Figure out which file contains the text you want to edit.

Page Title -> filename

homepage -> index.html
Document -> doc.html
Photo Gallery -> gallery.html
Other Docs -> other-docs.html
Looking For -> looking-for.html
About -> contact-us.html

1. Open Notepad. Go to File -> Open. A popup will appear. Change the dropdown from "Text Documents (*.txt)" to "All Files". Navigate to the repo root in the popup window. Open the file you want to edit.

2. Find the text/spot you want to change. For example, if I wanted to change the title of the homepage I would search for the text "The Squared Circle Postmarks World Wide". If I wanted to add something to the end of the homepage

Notepad has a feature called find that helps with this. Go to Edit -> Find. Type the text you want to find. Click "find next". It should highlight the text you are looking for. If it does not, make sure you spelled everything correctly with the right amount of spaces.

3. Make the change you want. Save the file.

4. Don't forget! Your changes will not appear on the internet until you commit! see commit-changes.txt
